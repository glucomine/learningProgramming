-map: associative array. key-value pairs.  ----
-multimap: map with duplicate keys            |--- in <map>
-set: container contains only key as value ---
-multiset: set with duplicate keys            |--- in <set>

unordered collection
-unordered_map: map organized by a hash func ----
-unordered_multimap                             |--- in <unordered_map>
-unordered_set: set organized by a hash func ----
-unordered_multiset                             |--- in <unordered_set>
